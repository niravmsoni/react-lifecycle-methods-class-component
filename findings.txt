87. Created a project 
    Used npx-create-react-app
    Removed unnecessary items
    Copied existing index.html of older project(To import all bootstrap and other things configured as part of older project)

88. Created class component, created state and installed axios
    Creating a class component namely "CycloPediaClassPage".
    We'll be using random API to get instructor as well as students that we'll be using in the application.
    We'll be storing instructor(object), studentList(array), studentCount(int) and hideInstructor(bool) in state

    src > Utility > api.jsx - Copied it from existing project.
    Instal axios - npm install axios

89. Main Lifecycle methods
        componentDidMount(){}
        componentDidUpdate(){}
        componentWillUnmount(){}
    
    Added distinct console logs in each of these methods
    Then, exported that component and consumed it in index.jsx

    componentDidMount()
    When doing npm start, we see the log "Component Did Mount" being printed in the console logs.
    
    TAKEAWAY - Whatever code we write inside componentDidMount, it will be immediately invoked as soon as the component is mounted.
    Load data in initial state or from a remote endpoint - Use componentDidMount()
    So, now, called the Random API written in api.jsx in componentDidMount().
    Able to see data being logged to console. Now, we'll extract information from response and then set it in the state

    Once information is set in state, then in the render method, we're checking whether this.state.instructor has data.
    Once populated, we'll render the Name, email and phone on the UI
