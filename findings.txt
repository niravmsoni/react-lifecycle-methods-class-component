87. Created a project 
    Used npx-create-react-app
    Removed unnecessary items
    Copied existing index.html of older project(To import all bootstrap and other things configured as part of older project)

88. Created class component, created state and installed axios
    Creating a class component namely "CycloPediaClassPage".
    We'll be using random API to get instructor as well as students that we'll be using in the application.
    We'll be storing instructor(object), studentList(array), studentCount(int) and hideInstructor(bool) in state

    src > Utility > api.jsx - Copied it from existing project.
    Instal axios - npm install axios

89. Main Lifecycle methods and componentDidMount in DETAIL
        componentDidMount(){}
        componentDidUpdate(){}
        componentWillUnmount(){}
    
    Added distinct console logs in each of these methods
    Then, exported that component and consumed it in index.jsx

    componentDidMount()
    When doing npm start, we see the log "Component Did Mount" being printed in the console logs.
    
    TAKEAWAY - Whatever code we write inside componentDidMount, it will be immediately invoked as soon as the component is mounted.
    Load data in initial state or from a remote endpoint - Use componentDidMount()
    So, now, called the Random API written in api.jsx in componentDidMount().
    Able to see data being logged to console. Now, we'll extract information from response and then set it in the state

    Once information is set in state, then in the render method, we're checking whether this.state.instructor has data.
    Once populated, we'll render the Name, email and phone on the UI 

90. componentDidUpdate()

    For now, added new HTML content to display student count.
    Used the studentCount value from the state. Added 2 new buttons > Add Student and Remove All students.
    Upon click, added 2 new handlers that modified the "studentCount" state value to current + 1 and 0 respectively

    Upon refreshing the page, we see do see 2 things in the logs:
    Render component
    Component Did Update -> Why was this invoked?

    Since we're fetching the instructor details on the load, once we have information, we're UPDATING the component.
    If we comment out the code to populate state with random API response, we are not modifying the component anymore(Since this.state.instructor will never have value).
    Due to which the Component Did update does not get printed in the console

    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DidMount() and DidUpdate()
    DidMount() -> Executes only once(For the very first time the component is rendered)
    DidUpdate() -> Executes everytime the component is re-rendered/updated(For ex: Add/remove button onClick event resulting in changes in HTML dom)

    render() -> This method will always be calledS
